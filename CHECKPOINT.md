# 3-Day Development Checkpoint - THIS IS ALL DONE (roughly 40% of the work)
Last Updated: [30.01.2025]


## Day 1: Foundation 🏗️

### Session 1: Tool Registration System ///// implement git + github - local and api operations
**Focus**: Simple config-based tool addition
- [ ] Update MCPTool interface
  > Create a minimal interface that defines a tool with name, description and server configuration, following Anthropic's tool structure. The interface should match the JSON config format used in tools.ts for seamless tool registration.
  
- [ ] Create standardized server registration
  > Implement server registration in MCPServerManager that takes server configs from tools.ts and initializes them with proper lifecycle management. Each server should handle its own tools and maintain its connection state.
  
- [ ] Add basic error recovery
  > Implement error handling for common server issues like connection failures or tool execution errors, with automatic reconnection attempts. The system should maintain stability even if individual tools or servers fail. 

**Deliverable**: Clean tool registration system that works with simple config updates

### Session 2: Task Schema & User Management -- SEE GARY
**Focus**: Core task infrastructure
- [ ] Create task and user schema
  > Design Prisma schema for tasks with essential fields and user management capabilities. Include user preferences storage for personalized bot behavior and task visibility settings.

- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations
  > Build a TaskRepository class that handles all database operations through Prisma Client, with built-in user context awareness. Operations should automatically scope to the requesting user's context.

- [ ] Add task validation and user checks
  > Create a validation layer that ensures task data integrity and proper user authorization. Include validation for task ownership and sharing permissions between users.

**Deliverable**: Working task database with user-aware operations

### Session 3: Task Commands
**Focus**: User-aware Discord commands
- [ ] Implement task creation (!task add)
  > Build a command handler that creates tasks in the user's context. Tasks should automatically be associated with the creating user and respect user-specific settings.

- [ ] Add task listing (!tasks list)
  > Create a task list formatter that filters tasks based on user context. Users should see their own tasks by default with options to view shared tasks.

- [ ] Create note management (!task note)
  > Implement note addition and viewing system that respects task ownership. Notes should include author tracking and proper permission checks.

**Deliverable**: Working user-specific task management via Discord

## Day 2: Enhancement 🛠️

### Session 4: Task Service
**Focus**: Business logic layer
- [ ] Create TaskManager service
  > Build a central service that coordinates task operations and maintains task state, with built-in user context awareness. Handle user-specific business logic and access controls.

- [ ] Add task querying methods
  > Implement flexible task querying that supports searching by various criteria and natural language queries. Queries should automatically scope to user context unless explicitly shared.

- [ ] Integrate with Discord service
  > Connect TaskManager with Discord service for real-time task updates and notifications. Handle message formatting and ensure proper error feedback to users.

**Deliverable**: Complete task management service

### Session 5: Conversation Memory
**Focus**: Context preservation
- [ ] Implement task context in conversations
  > Build a system that maintains conversation context regarding tasks, allowing for natural follow-up questions and commands. The context should include recently discussed tasks and their properties.

- [ ] Add task history tracking
  > Create a history system that records task operations and allows for reviewing past actions. Include the ability to reference and restore previous task states if needed.

- [ ] Create natural language query handling
  > Implement a natural language processor that can understand and respond to questions about tasks and their history. The system should handle various phrasings of similar queries.

**Deliverable**: Working memory system for tasks

### Session 5B: Core Server Setup
**Focus**: Server Integration
- [ ] Memory Server Configuration
  > Set up MCP memory server for project context, user preferences, and relationship tracking. Link with conversation system.

- [ ] Git Server Integration
  > Configure local git server for repository operations and file analysis. Implement core git operations.

- [ ] GitHub API Setup
  > Establish GitHub API connection for remote collaboration features. Enable issue and PR management.

**Deliverable**: Integrated server ecosystem

### Session 6: Tool Result Integration
**Focus**: Clean tool usage
- [ ] Implement standardized tool response handling
  > Create a system that processes tool outputs into a consistent format, making responses uniform regardless of the tool source. The handler should preserve important data while making output Discord-friendly.

- [ ] Add result formatting for Discord
  > Build a formatting system that presents tool results in an easily readable format with proper Discord markdown. Include support for code blocks, tables, and other rich formatting.

- [ ] Implement basic error handling
  > Create an error handling system that catches common tool execution issues and provides meaningful feedback. Include retry logic for transient failures and clear error messages for users.

**Deliverable**: Reliable tool usage system

## Day 3: Refinement ⚡

### Session 7: System Integration
**Focus**: Connect components
- [ ] Finalize service connections
  > Connect all major components (TaskManager, tools, Discord) through a clean dependency injection system. Ensure proper initialization order and handle service dependencies.

- [ ] Implement cross-service logging
  > Create a logging system that tracks operations across all services with proper context. Include important operation metadata and timing information for debugging.

- [ ] Add error recovery
  > Implement system-wide error recovery that handles service failures gracefully. Include automatic reconnection and state recovery where possible.

**Deliverable**: Integrated working system

### Session 8: Query Enhancement
**Focus**: Improve interaction
- [ ] Add natural language task creation
  > Build a natural language processor that can extract task information from casual conversation. The system should understand various ways of expressing task creation and modification.

- [ ] Implement context-aware responses
  > Create a context manager that maintains conversation state and provides relevant responses based on recent interactions. Include support for implicit references to previous tasks and commands.

- [ ] Enhance result formatting
  > Improve the formatting of all system outputs to be more readable and useful. Include rich formatting for task lists, search results, and status updates.

**Deliverable**: Enhanced user interaction

### Session 9: Testing & Documentation
**Focus**: System stability
- [ ] Test main workflows
  > Create a comprehensive test suite covering common user interactions and edge cases. Include tests for task operations, tool usage, and error conditions.

- [ ] Document usage patterns
  > Write clear documentation covering command syntax, natural language capabilities, and common usage patterns. Include examples of all major features.

- [ ] Create known issues list
  > Document any known limitations, edge cases, or planned improvements. Include workarounds for common issues and plans for future enhancements.

**Deliverable**: Stable, documented system
