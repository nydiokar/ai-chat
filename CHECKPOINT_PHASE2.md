# 3-Day Development Checkpoint (Phase 2)
Last Updated: [31.01.2025]

## Day 1: Memory System & Tool Enhancement 🧠

### Session 1: Memory System Foundation
**Focus**: Core memory infrastructure for better context
- [ ] Create MemoryRepository service
  > Implement a centralized memory store that can track:
  - User preferences (for command behavior customization)
  - Conversation contexts (for better response relevance)
  - Entity relationships (users, tasks, tools)
  - Command usage patterns

- [ ] Implement memory search/retrieval
  > Build efficient memory querying with:
  - Context scoring for relevance
  - Time-based decay for old memories
  - Cross-reference capability between entities

**Creative Addition**: Memory decay system - automatically reduce the relevance of older context but not delete it, making the bot feel more natural in long-term interactions.

**Deliverable**: Working memory system that other services can use

### Session 2: Tool Enhancement
**Focus**: Improve tool interaction and results
- [ ] Implement tool chaining
  > Create a system for tools to work together:
  - Chain definitions in config
  - Result passing between tools
  - Chain abort conditions
  
- [ ] Add result caching
  > Build caching system for tool results:
  - Cache strategy per tool type
  - Invalidation rules
  - Memory usage limits

**Creative Addition**: Chain abort conditions - prevent infinite loops or resource waste in tool chains while still allowing complex operations.

**Deliverable**: Enhanced tool system with chaining and caching

## Day 2: Advanced Task Features 📋

### Session 3: Recurring Tasks
**Focus**: Task automation and scheduling
- [ ] Add recurrence patterns
  > Support multiple recurrence types:
  - Daily/Weekly/Monthly
  - Custom intervals
  - End conditions

- [ ] Implement task spawning
  > Build system to:
  - Create instances of recurring tasks
  - Link to parent task
  - Maintain completion history

**Creative Addition**: Completion history tracking - help users see patterns in their task completion and optimize their scheduling.

### Session 4: Task Dependencies
**Focus**: Task relationships and workflows
- [ ] Create dependency system
  > Implement task dependencies:
  - Blocker/blocked relationship
  - Parallel vs sequential tasks
  - Circular dependency prevention

- [ ] Add status propagation
  > Handle status changes across dependencies:
  - Update dependent tasks
  - Notify affected users
  - Track dependency health

**Deliverable**: Complete task automation system

## Day 3: Integration & Optimization ⚡

### Session 5: Enhanced Context Awareness
**Focus**: Smart interaction handling
- [ ] Implement context scoring
  > Create a system to:
  - Score conversation relevance
  - Track topic transitions
  - Maintain multi-topic context

- [ ] Add smart references
  > Build natural reference handling:
  - Pronoun resolution ("it", "that task")
  - Implicit entity references
  - Cross-conversation references

**Creative Addition**: Topic transition tracking - help the bot maintain context even when conversations naturally drift between topics.

### Session 6: System Optimization
**Focus**: Performance and usability
- [ ] Implement query optimization
  > Enhance database queries:
  - Add proper indexes
  - Optimize common patterns
  - Add query caching

- [ ] Add performance monitoring
  > Create basic monitoring:
  - Response time tracking
  - Memory usage patterns
  - Tool usage statistics

**Deliverable**: Optimized system with monitoring

## Progress Metrics 📊

### Must Have by End of Phase 2
- Working memory system
- Tool chaining capability
- Recurring tasks
- Basic task dependencies
- Context awareness

### Nice to Have
- Advanced monitoring
- Performance optimization
- Complex tool chains

## Special Notes 📝
1. Focus on getting features working first, then add error handling
2. Each session is designed to deliver immediate value
3. Testing can be basic but cover core functionality
4. Documentation can be minimal but include key examples

**Creative Highlights**:
- Memory decay system for natural long-term interactions
- Chain abort conditions for safe tool automation
- Completion history for task optimization
- Topic transition tracking for better context awareness
