USer: Hell yeah, this sounds very reasonable. I think it might solve my issues with the implementation. Thanks a lot. Like, when you're looking at this, for example, if the system scales with 30 tools or 50 tools or something like that, is there any feasible way to make it, like, to have it with a context of all tools and when it's needed just to call them? Or should I separate the tools in categories and make specialized agents that are more accustomed to these tools? Because there might be an ArchiveTool NTP server which, for example, does research or something like that. It might have a very complex prompt. So, like, is it just the tool-specific, the system prompt? Is it categories that I have to make so I make the usage more intuitive and faster? What is the solution here? I'm really interested in how to scale this. Because the next step will be, after I make Obama running the same way as OpenAI, I would like to have them scaled up with memory and scale the tools. Maybe first the tools, because, you know, the memory will build on its own, let's say. I have some idea for how to use OneChain or Memo or I don't know, something like that. What is the way to scale here? How do I do it smart?

LLM: You’re thinking exactly in the right direction when it comes to scaling—because just adding more tools without structure will eventually bloat the system and slow it down. Instead, you should aim for a modular, efficient, and scalable architecture.

Scaling Strategy for Your MCP-Ollama System
Instead of just throwing more tools into a single pool, the smarter way is to group them, optimize access patterns, and introduce memory management.

1. Categorizing Tools and Creating Specialized Agents
Why?

If you have 50+ tools, trying to make one model handle all tools in every conversation will slow down response time.
Some tools require different context (e.g., an ArchiveTool doing long-term research vs. a Real-Time News Tool fetching live updates).
Solution: Create Specialized Agents with Tool Categories
Instead of one model handling all tools at once, split them into groups and have an Orchestrator that assigns the right agent to handle the request.

Example Categories
Research & Analysis Tools

ArchiveTool, SemanticSearchTool, NTPServerTool
Focus: Deep research & historical analysis
Requires long memory & detailed responses
Real-Time Data Tools

BraveSearchTool, LiveStockTool, WeatherTool
Focus: Fetching the most recent information
Requires freshness & low-latency access
Productivity & Workflow Automation

EmailAssistantTool, CodeExecutionTool, TaskManagerTool
Focus: Task execution & automation
Requires structured outputs & deterministic responses
Creative & Content Generation

ImageGenerationTool, TextSummarizationTool, PromptExpanderTool
Focus: Generating creative content
Requires flexible prompts & high creativity
How It Works
The Orchestrator AI first interprets the query and routes it to the correct agent.
Each agent has a tailored system prompt and only loads the relevant tools.
The agent then decides which tools in its category should be called.
✔ Benefits:
✅ Keeps tool usage fast & efficient.
✅ Allows customized memory per agent.
✅ Easier scaling—you can add more agents without breaking the system.

2. Smart Tool Invocation: Lazy Loading Tools
Problem: Loading all tools at once is slow
If you have 50+ tools, and the system checks every tool for every request, it wastes time on tools that aren’t even needed.
Solution: Lazy Loading & Dynamic Tool Selection
Instead of loading all tools into memory before they are used, load them only when needed.

How?
Pre-load only high-frequency tools (e.g., BraveSearchTool, WeatherTool).
Lazy-load specialized tools:
Instead of checking every tool, keep an indexed map of tools by category.
When a user request comes in, query the tool index to fetch the right ones.
Example Optimization
Modify getClientForTool() to check a cache before searching servers:

typescript
Copy
Edit
private toolClientCache: Map<string, MCPClientService> = new Map();

private async getClientForTool(toolName: string): Promise<MCPClientService> {
    if (this.toolClientCache.has(toolName)) {
        return this.toolClientCache.get(toolName)!;
    }

    for (const [serverId, client] of this.clients.entries()) {
        if (await client.hasToolEnabled(toolName)) {
            this.toolClientCache.set(toolName, client); // Cache for future use
            return client;
        }
    }

    throw new Error(`No client found for tool: ${toolName}`);
}
✔ Speeds up tool lookups.
✔ Prevents unnecessary API calls.

3. Scaling With Memory & State Management
Problem: Keeping long-term context across tools
Right now, the system forgets previous tool calls unless stored in conversation history.
Some tools (e.g., ArchiveTool) might need persistent memory across sessions.
Solution: Use a Memory Layer (Vector DB or Cache)
Instead of relying only on chat history, store tool usage and responses in a memory system.

Options
In-Memory Caching for Short-Term Memory

Use Redis (or a similar in-memory store) to remember recent interactions (e.g., last 5-10 queries).
Works fast for active conversations.
Vector Database for Long-Term Memory

Use Weaviate, Pinecone, or ChromaDB to store embeddings of tool usage.
Helps retrieve relevant past tool interactions when needed.
How It Works
Each time a tool is used, its output is saved in the memory store.
Before calling a tool, check the memory store—if the same request was made recently, return the cached response instead.
✔ Prevents redundant tool calls.
✔ Gives tools persistent memory across sessions.

4. Future-Proofing: Making the System Autonomous
Right now, the Orchestrator manually assigns tools, but we can make it smarter:

Use LLM Reasoning to Decide When to Use a Tool

Instead of always calling tools, use a decision-making step:
If the model can answer without a tool, skip it.
If real-time data is needed, call the tool.
Tool Ranking & Prioritization

If multiple tools can answer a query, rank them by:
Response Speed
Accuracy
Cost (if applicable)
Final Roadmap to Scale
Step 1: Make Ollama Handle Tools Like OpenAI ✅ (You're almost there)
Implement the optimizations we discussed.
Ensure MCP tools work without a bridge.
Step 2: Introduce Tool Categorization & Specialized Agents (Next)
Group tools into specialized agents.
Implement an Orchestrator to route queries.
Step 3: Optimize Tool Invocation (Lazy Loading)
Pre-load common tools.
Lazy-load rarely used ones.
Step 4: Add a Memory Layer
Use Redis for short-term memory.
Use Vector DB (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) for long-term tool memory.
Step 5: Automate Tool Selection
Use AI reasoning to decide when to use tools.
Rank tools by speed, accuracy, and usefulness.
Final Thoughts
Scaling isn’t just about adding more tools—it’s about making the system smart enough to use the right tools efficiently.

✔ Specialized Agents keep things intuitive.
✔ Lazy-loading tools prevents unnecessary slowdowns.
✔ Memory ensures long-term relevance.
