## Recent Improvements

### 1. Client Architecture
```typescript
// Simplified client creation
const client = container.getNamed(IMCPClient, serverId);
```

### 2. Response Handling
```typescript
// Flexible response transformation
const response = {
    success: true,
    data: rawResponse,
    metadata: {}
};
```

### 3. Configuration Management
```typescript
// Server-specific configuration
const config = {
    command: 'node',
    args: ['server.js'],
    env: process.env,
    name: serverId
};
```
